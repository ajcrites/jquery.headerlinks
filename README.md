# jQuery Headerlinks Plugin (0.0)

## Introduction
I created a jQuery plugin for practice and because I thought it would be a fairly good idea. Headerlinks dynamically and automatically (and quickly) creates an organized table-of-contents list anywhere you want on the page in any style.

The headerlinks plugin (if you are using JS) is what is making the nice table-of-contents block at the top of this page.

*## Purpose
The jQuery headerlinks plugin was designed to simplify and automate table-of-contents based on webpage hierarchy.

## Requirements

* jQuery 1.3+

## Documentation

http://explosion-pills.com/development/jquery/plugins/headerlinks/#headerlinks\_ident2

## Installation

Include jQuery.  Any time after that, include this script as you would any other script file.  You can then use `$("#table-of-contents-conatiner").headerlinks();` at will.

## Contributing

* Use three spaces for indentation
* Write `if (`, `for (`, and `function (` as opposed to `if(`, `for(`, `function(`
